# Eye-Blink-Counter
BlinkTrack is a real-time eye blink detection and counting system built using Python, OpenCV, and face landmark detection libraries like dlib or Mediapipe. This application captures video from a webcam, analyzes facial features frame-by-frame, and accurately counts the number of eye blinks over time.
